## Introduction

Formally, the Inventare Design System was inspired by some libs, like the Bootstrap, Chakra-UI, Material-UI and others. We decided to create it to maintain the consistency about our user interfaces belong all of our products and services.

> About our roadmap:
> 
> We are creating a custom django-admin template for some of our products at [inventare/django-admin-inventare](https://github.com/inventare/django-admin-inventare) and the base of the components in this design system are created to supply the necessity of the django-admin template.
>
> For the future, we are planning to refine this components and in most of the future, create new components required by another other products and services.
