# Button

Button component is an clickable interactive element that triggers a response and is used to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a Dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

You can place text and icons inside of a button.

## Usage

The component comes in different variants such as `primary`, `danger`, `large` and `small` which you can use to alter the look and feel of button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />

Button has the following properties:

<Controls />

### Color Variants

Some color variants are provided to the `<Button />`:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Danger} />

### Size Variants

In addictions to the color variants, we have two size variants to the `<Button />`. The small button and the large button:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.DangerSmall} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.PrimaryLarge} />

### Outline

Other way of customization of the `<Button />` are using the outline version:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.PrimaryOutline} />

### Square Buttons

If you want to create square buttons, for some reason, it is possible too:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.SquareDanger} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.SquareDangerOutline} />

### Disabled Buttons

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Loading State Indicator

Buttons are, generally, used to call actions or send forms and, in some moments, are needed to display loading indicator state into the buttons:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.LoadingCustom} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.LoadingSpinner} />

### Link Buttons

You can use the `as` property to change the output HTML Element of the `<Button />` tag. An example of it is:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.PrimaryLink} />

> The `as` property is adapted (or copied, maybe) from [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). Thanks for all creators and contributors of the Chakra-UI.

Is possible, also, use `react-router-dom` Link component inside the `as={}` property:

```jsx
// import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

<Button as={Link} to="/dashboard">
  Open
</Button>
```
