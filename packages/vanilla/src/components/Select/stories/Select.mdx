# Select

Select component is a component that allows users pick a value from predefined options. The select component is a custom vanilla JavaScript component with custom styles.

The main idea of this component is to write the HTML direct and not initialize from another structure. The idea is not have initialization, like the `ADR 0000` comments. This is used to add out of box HTMX support.
