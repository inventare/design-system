# ADR 0002: Why Are Stories Far From Component?

üóìÔ∏è 2025-04 ¬∑ ‚úçÔ∏è [@EduardoJM](https://github.com/eduardoJM/)

## Context

We need to think about a place to store the storybook stories.

## Decision Drivers

- We have a lot of components that are only `scss` files.
- We have a lot of components that are `scss` and `javascript` from `vanilla` package.
- We have a lot of components that are `tsx` in `react` package.

## Decision

We opted to create a `stories` folder inside the `apps/docs` to store `scss` and `vanilla` components and create a `stories` folder inside the `apps/docs-react` to store the `react` components.

The reason for opted this is:

1. Maintain all `vanilla` and `scss` components in the same place.
2. Maintain all `react` components in the same place.
3. Maintain consistency along all the `scss` and `vanilla` stories and documentations.
